## About me

I am a freelance digital product designer and front-end developer with a focus in data visualization and interactive media. In 2015 I graduated from MIT's [Comparative Media Studies](//cms.mit.edu) program, creating my own major that blended computer science, interaction design, and the social sciences.

I was born in Los Angeles, but grew up in Hong Kong and went to school in Boston. I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I am currently seeking a full-time position (remote teams are ðŸ‘Œ too). You can see my technical qualifications and previous job experience on [my resume](/resume/).

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch with me is through Twitter at [@s2tephen](//twitter.com/s2tephen). You can also shoot me an email at [ssuen@mit.edu](mailto:ssuen@mit.edu), if you're not into the whole brevity thing. I am availablle to meet over Skype/Google Hangout or IRL if we happen to be in the same city.
