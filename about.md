## About me

I am a digital product designer and front-end developer with a focus in data visualization and interactive media. Currently, I work at [Cloudstitch](//cloudstitch.com), a startup making web development more accessible with the untapped power of the office suite. I am from Hong Kong and majored in [Comparative Media Studies](//cmsw.mit.edu) at MIT. For an overview of my skills and (rather eclectic) story so far, see [my resume](/resume/).

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch with me is through Twitter at [@s2tephen](//twitter.com/s2tephen). You can also [shoot me an email](mailto:stephen@cloudstitch.com), if you're not into the whole brevity thing. I am available to meet over Skype/Google Hangout or IRL if we happen to be in the same city.
