## About me

I recently graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I majored in [Comparative Media Studies](//cms.mit.edu), blending computer science, design, and the social sciences. There, I was the online media and interactives editor at the school newspaper, [*The Tech*](//thetech.com).

I was born in Los Angeles, but I grew up in Hong Kong and now live in Boston. I am seeking a full-time position as a digital designer or front-end developer, particularly in news and media. You can see my qualifications in [my resume](/resume/).

## Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is through Twitter at [@s2tephen](//twitter.com/s2tephen). You can also shoot me an email at [ssuen@mit.edu](mailto:ssuen@mit.edu), if you're not into the whole brevity thing. I am available to meet over Skype/Google Hangout or IRL in the Boston area.
