Founded by my brother [Michael](//whoismichaelsuen.com) in 2009, [21st Century Boy](//21cb.net) (or 21CB or short) is a blog dedicated to the current affairs, popular culture, and web trends of Asia and the Asian diaspora. At the time, there were few English language websites covering the region from a youth and web culture perspective. What first started as Michael's one-man personal Wordpress site eventually grew into an international blogging project, with over 10 correspondents and contributors. I was brought on in 2010 to help redesign the site and serve as its primary web developer and technical coordinator.

In this role, I was responsible for front-end development on 21st Century Boy's custom Wordpress theme, building page templates as well as maintaining our social media, analytics, and advertising plugins. We redesigned the site yet again in 2011 — at the peak of its popularity, 21st Century Boy was receiving 80,000 pageviews per month, thanks to our clean yet bold design, unique editorial voice, and social media outreach.

In addition to my development responsibilities, I was also a [writer for the website](//www.21cb.net/author/Stephen-Suen/), focusing mainly on internet culture and technology. During my tenure, I covered everything from [xenophobic political ads](//www.21cb.net/cagw-downfall-parodies) to [fake Apple stores in China](//www.21cb.net/fake-apple-stores-china). My stories were picked up by [TIME.com](//world.time.com/2011/08/16/a-week-later-the-battle-to-understand-englands-riots-rages-on) and [Geekosystem](//www.themarysue.com/china-tweet-labor-camp) (now The Mary Sue). I also liveblogged talks and events for the site. In 2011, the site went on an indefinite hiatus — as Michael graduated from college and I was just starting it — but we plan to revisit the 21st Century Boy brand in the future for other potential projects.
