  - "Yes, I've officially graduated from the popular Firebug extension for web developers, basically the only feature I still used Firefox for outside of compatibility testing."
  - "Though this is not the full “Why CMS?” post. I will write something about that at a later date and discuss the state of the humanities at MIT."
  - "For the uninitiated: “rule 34” of the internet states that, if it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions. Rule 35, the oft-cited corollary to this rule, states that, if porn of it doesn't exist, then it will be made."

![Everything Was Made, by Frank Chimero.](/assets/img/chimero.png){: .full}

I address the inaugural post of the new-and-improved STEPHENSUEN.COM to writer and designer [Frank Chimero](http://twitter.com/fchimero), whose [personal website](http://frankchimero.com) I heavily borrowed from in the process of redesigning my own. The circular logo based on my initials, the site's colored border, the typography, and the navigation bar/footer were all inspired by Frank's elegant design choices.

Actually, the word “inspired” may a little generous. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say stolen. Ripped. Copied. Poached. Pirated. This post is phrased not a statement of thanks, but as an apology. Nevertheless, in my optimism, I imagine that Frank is not offended by my appropriation of his ideas, but encouraged by it. I imagine him happy—or at worst, indifferent.

In his thought-provoking visual essay “[Everything Was Made](http://frankchimero.com/writing/2012/everything-was-made/)” Frank waxes philosophical about design and its purpose. He writes:

>{: .basic}We make what we want, break things in the process, collect what we like, and connect what we discover to get us closer to where we want to be.

Maybe I'm misrepresenting his point here, but Frank seems to be portraying creation as a process of synthesis—it's no coincidence that he constantly refers to the codependency inherent to making things. At the very least, that's my opinion when it comes to creativity: it's an act of recombination and reinterpretation. [Remix](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series).

And this manifests itself in everything I do. You didn't really think that Frank Chimero was the only person I borrowed from in the process of making this website, did you? Here's the rest of the people whose work I appropriated to make it all happen:

+ **[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/)** — For obvious reasons. Though to my credit I did build this theme from scratch, rather than modifying an existing one like I usually do.
+ **[ZURB](http://www.zurb.com/)** — For their new [Foundation 3](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS framework. Thanks to these guys, my website now supports mobile browsing!
+ **[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/)** — For the general anatomy/structure of an article. I may steal their social media sharing button layout in the near future.
+ **[Grantland](http://www.grantland.com/)** — For their fancy sidenotes functionality, which I've recreated using a footnotes plugin and the magic of jQuery.[1](#fn-1){: #fnref-1}
+ **[Jon Hicks](http://twitter.com/hicksdesign)** of **[Hicksdesign](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/)** — For the presentation of post metadata.
+ **[Jason Kottke](http://twitter.com/jkottke)** of **[Kottke.org](http://kottke.org/)** — For all the hyperlink styles.
+ **[Bobby Solomon](http://twitter.com/thefoxisblack)** of **[The Fox Is Black](http://www.thefoxisblack.com/)** — For the lazy loading images.
+ **[Alex Leavitt](http://twitter.com/alexleavitt)**, and also my brother **[Michael](http://twitter.com/poetichentai)** — For resume/CV design, and some content-related things like self-branding.

Throughout the design process, I always had these websites open in background tabs. I took them apart with Chrome's Developer Tools.[2](#fn-2){: #fnref-2} I disemboweled them and harvested their organs for my own abomination. And no doubt I copied from countless more: the people whose plugins I'm using; other websites that have subconsciously informed my design sensibilities.

But I digress. This is not an Oscar acceptance speech. The reason I bring this all up is twofold. First, to credit those who have contributed, willingly or unwillingly, to the building of this site in a sort of pseudo-colophon. I've done that. More importantly, I want to frame exactly why I have chosen to study the internet.[3](#fn-3){: #fnref-3} In the end, it all has to do with my brother.

![My brother and I.](/assets/img/siblings.jpeg)

The great existential crisis of my adolescence has always been my relationship with Michael. Sibling rivalry was always a foreign concept to me as a child. When I was younger, in [my adoration for my brother](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship), I tried to copy him in all respects—I lived vicariously through him, telling his stories to my friends on the bus, and passing off his insight as my own in the classroom.

When I started high school, my brother left for college and in the first time in my life, I was alone: a copy without an original. I could no longer tell where I ended and my brother began. At first I struggled to differentiate myself from Michael, looking for words to call my own, only to find myself gravitating to the same interests as he had. That's all I'd ever be, a pastiche of my brother.

>{: .left}If I can prove that derivative works have value beyond their originals, I can validate my own existence.

It's only in the last few years that I've relented. I stopped worrying and I learned to love my intellectual kleptomania. I embrace it. This is why I chose media studies. I want to examine derivative works of media: remixes, memes, mods, fanmade content. I feel that—if I can somehow prove that these works have value beyond their originals—maybe I can validate my own existence.

And what better place to look for them than the internet? If growing up on the web has taught me anything, it's that nobody is safe from the remix. The sheer amount of fanfiction and kinky rule 34[4](#fn-4){: #fnref-4} out there can attest to that. As can this website. Nobody is untouchable. Not J.K. Rowling, not Eiichiro Oda, and not Lauren Faust. Not Markus Persson, not Frank Chimero, and certainly not me.

So that brings us full circle. I proudly present to you the second coming of STEPHENSUEN.COM. Here, I hope to document my explorations into internet research, media studies, and much more. I'll post regular updates about my work in and out of school, as well as more informal essays about popular culture or whatever else might be on my mind.

Don't expect future posts to be as deeply personal and melodramatic as this one was; I just wanted to give you an idea of where I'm coming from. With that out of the way, welcome to the site. Remember: any comments or feedback are greatly appreciated! Consider following [me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/s2tephen) if you want to get updates as soon as they happen. Otherwise—enjoy!
