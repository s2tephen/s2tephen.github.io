  - "HASS = Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Yes, MIT has a [school for it](http://shass.mit.edu/). All MIT undergrads must take eight HASS classes to graduate. Sadly, the term is usually invoked with contempt or derision."
  - "I had to actually apply to get into this class, with a portfolio and everything. Pulling all the materials together was nostalgic, to say the least. If you're interested, you can see [what I submitted](http://ssuen.scripts.mit.edu/cms634/)—it's definitely more interesting than what I have on this site right now."
  - "I've actually already finished a first draft of my paper, but am currently in the process of revising it for submission to journals and/or conferences. I'm still new to this whole academia thing, so give it some time."

Wondering what I've been up to recently? I don't blame you—this blog has been gathering dust between schoolwork, my deep dive into journalism, and other IRL shenanigans. That ends today. Thanks to my product design and software classes last term and having to learn how things work at The Tech, consider me now a firm believer in DOCUMENTING ALL THE THINGS.

With that, I am proud to announce my triumphant return to regularly-scheduled blogging. I can't promise daily updates, but do expect there to be healthy doses of new content from time to time. The power of routine cannot be underestimated, and that's something I plan to embrace wholeheartedly this semester on all fronts: exercise and fitness, sketching and design, and—of course—writing and blogging!

We just started "real" school here at MIT last week,[1](#fn-1){: #fnref-1} which means that I am once again taking classes at the ‘tvte. As a [CMS major](http://cms.mit.edu/), I enjoy a great deal of flexibility in terms of choosing what classes to take. This semester, I've opted to go all-out and take a bunch of design classes. Project-based, creative, no finals. Just the way I like it. Here are the courses I'm currently registered for and some preliminary thoughts:

**2.00B** Toy Product Design  
A hands-on introduction to the product design process through the lens of toy design. Teams work with local sponsors, elementary schools, and industry mentors to design and prototype a toy product. Browse the [course website](http://web.mit.edu/2.00b/www/pages/courseinfo.html) for previous projects.

**6.813** User Interface Design  
Taught by the [User Interface Design](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/index.shtml) group at [CSAIL](http://stephensuen.com/blog/www.csail.mit.edu). Probably the most technically challenging class I'm taking, but most relevant to the work I'm going to be doing in the future. The focus is solely on usability, with a web app as the final product.

**CMS.621** Fans and Fan Cultures  
The spirit of [Henry Jenkins](http://henryjenkins.org/) lives on via this class. More of a traditional HASS subject,[2](#fn-2){: #fnref-2} the class investigates fan cultures and aca-fandom. Taught by a different professor than in previous years, but I have high hopes for the course material.

**CMS.634** Designing Interactions: Media and Mobile Technologies[3](#fn-3){: #fnref-3}  
Brand new class from the [MIT Mobile Experience Lab](http://mobile.mit.edu/). Super interdisciplinary: a great blend of mechanical engineers, coders, architects, and media scholars are enrolled. This year's topic: [rethinking the hotel lobby experience](http://architecture.mit.edu/computation/subject/designing-interactions-rethinking-hotel-experience), in partnership with Marriott.

**CMS.S98** Qualitative Social Science Methods for Media Studies  
A legit qualitative research methods class—interviewing, participant observation, focus groups, ethnography, etc. Relevant for both internet academia and user research. Taught by [T.L. Taylor](http://tltaylor.com/), ethnographer of virtual worlds and now esports.

<s>**MAS.S63** Fundamentals of Visual Communication  
Kind of a wildcard class I added last-minute. Taught by a bunch of folks at the [Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu/). Covers a broad range of topics including typography, layout, animation, 3D modeling. Taking this because I've never actually had formal training in graphic design.</s>

TL;DR, it's going to be a tough but rewarding semester. So why bother adding more work to an already-full plate and commit to regular blogging? Documentation, as mentioned before, but also as a way of staying sane. I've already got some ideas lined up for regular features—let me know what you think!

Off the top of my head: notes from my classes (would that be boring?), progress on my [meme research](http://civic.mit.edu/blog/s2tephen/tracking-the-meme-ification-of-the-2012-presidential-election),[4](#fn-4){: #fnref-4} film/TV reviews, weekly conceptual design challenges (inspired by IDEO's [I Miss My Pencil](http://www.ideo.com/by-ideo/i-miss-my-pencil)), a regular roundup of links/internet interestingness, and post-mortems/process posts from my work at [The Tech](http://tech.mit.edu/) or my shows at [WMBR](http://wmbr.mit.edu/). Content-wise, it'll be a mixed bag, so visit soon, and visit often. And comment!
